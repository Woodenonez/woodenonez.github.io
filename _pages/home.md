## Greetings!

Welcome to my personal page. I am currently a PhD student in the [Group of Automation](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control/automation/) at the [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). My research interests are in the area of mobile robotics and deep learning, particularly in the development of integrated algorithms for predictive dynamic obstacle avoidance based on multimodal motion prediction.
